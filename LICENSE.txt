Translation for humans: I, as the creator, give you permission to use the code I've written to execute for your own use.
You can even modify the code to your liking. You are not permitted to use this code in your other projects you plan to sell.

If you plan to distribute free software publicly, and want to include this code in some fashion, that's fine! Just credit myself
and Smiley Barry for our work with the Steam API.
